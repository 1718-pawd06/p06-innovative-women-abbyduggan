        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p> Virginia Apgar was the first female professor at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. She was born in 
        Westfield New Jersey on June 7th, 1909, the 3rd child of Charles E. and Helan May Apgar. She's known for her charisma,charm, and
        most notably, her energy.Many believe her desire to be a doctor came not only from her father's love of astronomy, but also at 
        her brother's chronic illness. Though she was gifted in science, she failed miserably in home economics; her friends even claim 
        she never learned to cook!
